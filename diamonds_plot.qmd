## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r libraries}

library(ggplot2)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r plot}

# Create a scatter plot of carat vs price
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, color = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Diamond Price vs Carat",
    x = "Carat",
    y = "Price (USD)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
